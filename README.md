## Generative Tool for Predicting New Anticancer Peptides

This was a machine learning research project I conducted in 2021. For technical details, I've linked my research publication below here:

## Description: ##

- Designed four predictive supervised learning models (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, and Deep learning neural network) to make predictions on whether a given peptide carries anti-cancer properties. 
- Further created a generative machine learning predictor using a long short-term recurrent neural network and a sliding window to predict 40 new drugs for cancer. 


## Tools and Dependencies ##

- Developed in Python 3 with Keras, numpy, sklearn, pandas, pickle, and Bio
